# Elasticsearch-Filebeat-Kibana stack to monitor Nginx logs

## Contents
- Nginx: containing build image nginx web server
- Elasticsearch: containing build image and configuration for Elasticsearch
- Filebeat: containing build image and configuration for Filebeat to stream nginx logs Elasticsearch
- Kibana: containing build image and configure for Kibana to visualize data from an Elasticsearch index

## How it works

- Nginx access and error logs are written to a directory. The directory is mapped to a local volume.
- Filebeat reads the nginx logs from the local volume and sends it to an Elasticsearch index [filebeat-*].
- Kibana uses the index to visualize the access and the error logs.

- docker
- docker-compose
